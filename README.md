### Stock Market Analysis

# CSCI 4502 Final Project

Team Members: JC Abrahamson, Garrett Hempy, Kevin Ruby, Jameson Marzak

Background: The purpose of this project is to bring many of the evaluation tools that HFT trading uses to create predictive models that better help users analyze their current portfolios. Unlike a lot of trading practices today, we will still keep the power in the hands of the user. Our goal is not to eliminate the need for humans in trading, but rather to provide the necessary tools to allow the user to make the best trading decisions.
